1. Sign in to [aka.ms/cdx](https://aka.ms/cdx) using your partner account.
1. Select the **My Environments** tab, and then, under **My tenants**, select the **Create Tenant** button.
1. As the type, select **Quick Tenant**.
1. As the period, select **90 days**. You can't select **1 year**.

    Your account in CDX has access to a limited quota of tenants that can last three months (90 days). Learn more at [CDX FAQ](https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/help/faq).  
1. As the location, choose the region that is closest to your location.

    This setting determines the location in which the tenant is deployed, but you can add [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environments to it for any country/region afterwards.  

1. Choose one of the available content packs and then select the **Create Tenant** button.  

    Content packs offer different bundles of Microsoft software free trials. Each content pack typically results in a dedicated demonstration organization in Azure and multiple demonstration users, including preconfigured Microsoft 365 or Dynamics 365 applications. You can choose any of the content packs that match your prospects' industry or interests, and then add Business Central to the tenant afterwards.

    If you're uncertain which content pack is a fit for you, we recommend one of the following packs:

    - **Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement** currently includes Microsoft 365 Copilot, Power Platform, and the Dynamics 365 apps that Business Central typically integrates with.
    - **Microsoft 365 Enterprise Demo Content** currently includes demonstration data that simulates an organization that is using Microsoft 365.

    These content packs give you a dedicated demonstration organization in Azure that includes multiple demo users with Microsoft 365 licenses.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > When demand for a specific content pack is high, the **Create Tenant** button isn't activated, and you must choose a different content pack.

1. When the tenant is created, a page appears with details of tenant. Keep the page open because you need administrator email and password in the next step.
1. Sign up for a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] trial by completing the following steps:

   1. In a dedicated browser window, visit [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/business-central)
   1. Select the **Try for free**
   1. Follow the online instructions to fill in the information required to sign up to Business Central. For the email, use the new administrator account email that you got as part of your demo account in the previous step.

    > [!TIP]
    > We recommend that you use profiles in the Microsoft Edge browser rather than InPrivate or Incognito browser mode. Learn more at [Microsoft Edge](/microsoft-edge/).

By now, you have a dedicated demonstration organization in Azure that includes multiple demo users with Microsoft 365 licenses, and a [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] environment.

The initial [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)] demo environment comes with two companies:

- The CRONUS demonstration company  
- An empty company with the name *My Company*, but it might have a different display name for demo purposes  

You can keep using the demonstration company until the tenant expires, if you use it a couple of times per week. However, if you start the trial experience or switch to the empty *My Company*, that experience will expire after 30 days. If the trial expires, you can extend the trial, create a new environment, or return to the CRONUS demonstration company. Learn more at [Dynamics 365 Business Central Trials and Subscriptions](/dynamics365/business-central/across-preview) in the business functionality content for [!INCLUDE [prod_short](prod_short.md)].

You can now enable the *Premium* user experience in the new company's **Company Information** page, populate the company with any data that is required for their evaluation scenarios, and present the environment to the prospect.
